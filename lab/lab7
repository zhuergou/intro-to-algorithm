In this lab you will implement the dynamic programming algorithm to compute the edit distance between two strings, as given in Section 6.3.
Your program should input two strings XX and YY and print the edit distance between them, as well as the alignment of the two strings.
For example, given XX = EXPONENTIAL and YY = POLYNOMIAL, the output should be:
edit distance = 6
alignment:
EXPONEN-TIAL
--POLYNOMIAL
Report your output on the following strings:
XX = 'CATAAGCTTCTGACTCTTACCTCCCTCTCTCCTACTCCTGCTCGCATCTGCTATAGTGGAGGCCGGAGCAGGAACAGGTTGAACAG'
YY = 'CGTAGCTTTTTGGTTAATTCCTCCTTCAGGTTTGATGTTGGTAGCAAGCTATTTTGTTGAGGGTGCTGCTCAGGCTGGATGGA'
